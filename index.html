      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I was born in Vietnam, and immigrated to the United States at the age of three. As a child, I had many dreams
        for what I wanted to be when I grew up, including children's book writer, zoologist, counselor, and working in
        the gift wrapping department of a store. I also enjoy mopping floors, for whatever reason. In college, I studied
        psychology, and later, social work. I used to work as a medical social worker but recently quit to learn coding.
        In my spare time, I love reading pop psychology books, baking square-shaped buttermilk biscuits, and drawing
        anime characters. I am also a fan of board games, foreign films, and Welsh corgis. Contact me if you'd like to
        know more! </p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I have 25 first cousins.</li>
          <li>My favorite book is <em>Matilda</em> by Roald Dahl.</li>
          <li>I used to collect coins and currency from other countries.</li>
          <li>When I was 13, I was obsessed with the movie <em>The Matrix</em>.</li>
          <li>I'm the kind of person who watches <em>Jeopardy!</em> and shouts out the answer.</li>
          <li>I'm also the kind of person who watches a movie and grumbles, "That's not what happened in the book," the
            entire time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Name Origin Story</h2>
        <p>When I was born, my parents took me to a fortune-teller who prophesized three things about my life:
          <ol>
            <li>I would become a rough-and-tumble girl. A tomboy, in other words.</li>
            <li>I would be rich early on in life.</li>
            <li>I would become a dentist.</li>
          </ol>
          My parents were agreeable with these last two parts, but my father wanted to counteract the first prophecy. To
          this end, he named me LanChi, which means "orchid branch", because the orchid is supposed to be a delicate
          flower. Lo and behold, only the first prophecy has come true, proving the fortune-teller wrong and leaving my
          parents disappointed.

          Interestingly, there is a dentist in California who is also named LanChi Pham. Hmm...
