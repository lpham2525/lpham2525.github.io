            <h2>Biography</h2>
   
            <p> Born in Viet Nam, my family and I immigrated to the United States when I was three. As a child, I had a
              lot of dreams for what I wanted to be when I grew up, including children's book writer, zoologist,
              counselor, and working in the gift wrapping department of a store. In college, I studied psychology and
              social work. I worked as a medical social worker for the last five years, but recently quit to study
              coding. In my spare time, I love reading pop psychology books, baking square-shaped buttermilk biscuits,
              and drawing anime characters in fancy costumes. I am also a fan of board games, foreign films, and Welsh
              corgis. Contact me if you'd like to know more! </p>

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li >I have 25 first cousins</li>
              <li >I watch <em>Jeopardy!</em> religiously.</li>
              <li >I used to collect coins and currency from other countries.</li>
              <li >I'm the kind of person who watches a movie and grumbles, "That's not what
                happened in the
                book," the entire time.</li>
            </ul>

      <!-- <h2>Name Origin Story</h2>
        <!-- <p>When I was born, my parents took me to a fortune-teller who prophesized three things about my life:
          <ol>
            <li>I would become a rough-and-tumble girl. A tomboy, in other words.</li>
            <li>I would be rich early on in life.</li>
            <li>I would become a dentist.</li>
          </ol>
          My parents were agreeable with these last two parts, but my father wanted to counteract the first prophecy. To
          this end, he named me LanChi, which means "orchid branch", because the orchid is supposed to be a delicate
          flower. Lo and behold, only the first prophecy has come true, proving the fortune-teller wrong and leaving my
          parents disappointed. Interestingly, there is a dentist in California who is also named LanChi Pham. Hmm...
